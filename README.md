# Unit 02: CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Resonsive Portfolio

## Description

For this project, I took I used the grid system in Bootstrap to build a professional portfolio site. The site is a portfolio. There are three pages included in this Porfolio - About Me, Portfolio, and Contact. An HTML document was first created for each page. They were styled by a linked CSS file.  A reset CSS file is linked to all the pages to reset the stylesheet.  This reduces browser inconsistencies. 

There were some challenges in building this site including space under the header, not getting the background image to appear, and formatting issues.  

The goal of this Portfolio, if it were up to standard, would be for an employer to learn about the developer, view their work and contact them.

## Installation

Terminal needs to be executed to provide a command line interface.  This application gives the user text-based access to the operating system.  Visual Studio Code was installed and used as the source-code editor.  USer created a GitHub account to make use of it's repository hosting service.
